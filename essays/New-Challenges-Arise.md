summary: My two cents involving my first experience with using Semantics UI.
---

Using Semantics UI for the first time came with many struggles as I'd expect using any framework or program language for the first time. 
Despite that, I noticed some useful features that it does present. The website for Semantics UI is very helpful when looking back at code
structures for building your own website, etc. It was also organized in such a way that it made retreiving desired content quick and 
painless. A feature in particular that I like is how the interface notifies you of any syntax errors and provides quick fixes to solve
the issue. I found it difficult remembering the coding structures and organizing my code without forgetting something crucial. In the previous homework assignments and practice WODs, I noticed my struggles tend to arise during the halfway point in the completetion process. Though, I have a tendency to not check and run my code as often as I should there were instances when I would have to refer to 
the website and redo lines of code. There is much improvement on my part with that and something to consider resolving sooner rather than later. In order to better and eventually fully understand the UI, more time must be spent on revewing the coding structure. 

Learning Semantic UI is worth all the time and frustration since many companies will expect you do be familiar with the coding style as it could be considered as a requirement on a resume. The more knowledgeable an individual is with UI frameworks the more oppourtunities will arise even when you least expect it. Overcoming these struggles generally provides some form of benefit though sometimes it may not be easily noticeable. By getting a better understanding of one UI framework will make learning another one easier and hopefully with a lot less frustration. I think the greatest benefit for being skilled in UI are the potential jobs out there, which most likely apply these ideas in to projects and other assignments.
