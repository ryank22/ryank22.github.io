summary: My two cents involving my first experience with using Semantics UI.
---

Using Semantics UI for the first time came with many struggles as I'd expect using any framework or program language for the first time. 
Despite that, I noticed some useful features that it does present. The website for Semantics UI is very helpful when looking back at code
structures for building your own website, etc. It was also organized in such a way that it made retreiving desired content quick and 
painless. A feature in particular that I liked is how the interface notifies you of any syntax errors and provides quick fixes to solve
the issue.
