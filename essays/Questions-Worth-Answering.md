In every aspect of learning there will come a time when help is needed, and how a question is asked determines the quality of the response. We as individuals sometimes are susceptible to certain weaknesses that involve taking a more convenient route when the obvious path is the optimal of the two, even if it involves various obstacles. These difficulties strengthen us allowing an opportunity to grow and expand. 

Questions are an integral way for human beings to learn and gain a better understanding of a particular idea or subject matter. In software engineering for example, coding has to be precise and unambiguous such that any little error will result in complications. The same applies to asking questions, since the work has to be thorough so does the questions. A question has to be extremely precise otherwise the individual answering will have no clue on how to properly answer the question. Nothing positive or beneficial comes out of the entire process. 

Homework assignments are intended to be challenging and not to be taken so lightly. Multiple attempts should be taken with a problem, and if issues still exist, help should be considered as an option. It is necessary for one to struggle and make a legitimate attempt at solving a problem by themselves first. Each failed attempt is not a waste of time, but useful as it provides you with experience and allows you to build on your previous trials. Using an online source for ideas/hints can be potentially good as it can be poor. Not only should the source be credited, but also the question asked must be thorough and precise as possible. In this example, the author of the post uses a meaningful subject header, writes in grammatically correct language, uses informative and precise speech, writes in a polite format and sets up a question simple enough for the individual providing assistance to understand. These are a handful of factors in how to ask a “smart” question while receiving a “smart” answer in return.

On the other hand, there are those that have a tendency to ask questions in the not so “smart” way as this link provides an example of that. Sometimes all it requires is a little more effort in reformatting a "not so smart" question in to a "smart" one. However, other times questions can be totally subjective and completely off topic. Using this link as an example, the author does everything in the complete opposite way with respect to the "smart" method. For instance, the subject header is not only confusing, but also not even a valid question to begin with. Rather than thoroughly explaining the issue, the author briefly describes his wishes using a few words and a link to another website.

After reviewing various posts by authors on StackOverflow and reading Eric Steven Raymond's article, "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way", it has come to my attention the significant difference between asking questions the "smart way" and the "not so smart" way. In his article, he clearly describes what ideas should be taken in to consideration when asking a software engineering related question. This experience has given me a clearer understanding of how to approach such a situation. Answers to such questions are meant to enlightening and guide you in the proper direction rather than revealing the answer itself.
