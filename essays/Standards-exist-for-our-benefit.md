summary: My personal thoughts regarding our first week of using ESLint with IntelliJ and other related topics.

Coding standards is useful in many ways and in one such way, it is the basis in which code is written in an organized manner. Code that is written in a particular format allows not only the writer, but the reader as well, a much clearer perspective of the code as a whole and may very well offer the reader a thing or two because of it. Following a set of rules teaches everyone to take on the same habits and thus as they say, "be on the same page." It is important and necessary to follow guidelines so that each individual writes in the same style. Readability and consistency are two qualities that should be taken in to consideration as it provides the desired results each coder aspires to master. For an individual who is relatively new at coding can learn much through approriate coding structure. Each line of code has to be precise and unambigious and sometimes all it takes for a program to not compile or run is the most minute error that often times can easily be overlooked due to improper coding structure. In my experience, following these guidelines can potentially save you anywhere from minutes to hours as it prevents such errors from coming about.

I find that after using ESLint with IntelliJ to be a somewhat comfortable, but challenging learning experience. Initially, it was frustrating during the download and initializing process as errors occured. In one instance, IntelliJ warned me of an initialization error that could not locate a module. With few attempts, I was unsuccessful in locating a solution and eventually searched the web for any helpful answers. After reading several suggestions, which said to reinstall npm and use other related commands I was able to fix the problem. Once everything worked as it should though, I felt the layout and error checking functions made coding easier providing myself a sense of relief. The green checkmark was helpful to me, especially those pop-up boxes that specified coding errors. After changing the defaults and doing practice exercises the process became almost natural. 

After spending many hours of coding, I realized how important it is to name variables with relation to its function and not something unclear. Not only does it confuse the reader, but may confuse the author as well when backtracking or editing lines of code. These mistakes allow you to improve your abilities and prevent "laziness" from becoming a common occurrence. After all, by saving hours on preventing these errors from popping up will give you the oppourtuniy to spend more time advancing in your coding abilities.
