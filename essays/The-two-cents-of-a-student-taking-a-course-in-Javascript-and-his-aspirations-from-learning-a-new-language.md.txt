Ever since I began learning how to code, my feelings were unclear as what to expect from each language and the difficulty it would be for me to adapt to each one. I've taken courses in the past where it involved knowing languages such as Java, C and C++. Although each are different, they do share simlarities in terms of format and syntax errors. With regards to Javascript, it follows similar guidelines as well, which gives you a heads up on proper requirements to code in that language. Having previous experience with other languages provide much needed assistance and gives helpful insight with understanding the coding structure in Javascript. The learning process is hastened allowing you to pick up new material while also understanding it at a quicker pace.

I strongly believe that Javascript is one of the most useful program languages for software engineering. C++ for example, in comparison to Javascript has much more complicated methods and procedures, which can cause issues during the entire learning process. Efficiency is key and helpful in learning material with little or no prior experience. Functions can be generated dynamically and with more capabilities such as assigning variable functions, creating collections of functions, returning a function as a value of functions, etc. It can done more simply and concisely, which is extremely helpful when learning the source material.

The practice WODs are useful as they reinforce the importance of knowing the source material and gives us motivation/a reason to stay up to date and ahead of our class assignments and exercises. However, it can be a tad nerve-racking and stressful as it puts pressure on us to ensure the required coding in a short time period. The idea of full or no credit is probably the only frustrating aspect of taking WODs. Although, it is understandable that in reality, assignments and projects should be perceived as being either right or wrong with partially correct not being an option. With that being said, it provides a neccessary example of what to expect in real-world situations. I need to train myself to focus more on situations where pressure exists; WODs being one example. It may cause some difficulty for me initially, and potentially take awhile to adjust to its methods, but in the long run, WODs will help me to better discipline myself and focus on these situations where being pressured is a constant struggle. My grade for the course will most likely be affected because of it, but will provide much added benefit in the learning process as a whole.

Althletic software engineering is an interesting concept that previously I was not aware of with a principle of developing skills in specific environments. As mentioned by the professor, there is so much material in software engineering to cover in one semester that A.S.E. principles make it possible for students to accomplish obtainable goals in a short period of time. I agree with these concepts wholeheartedly and hope to achieve the desired results by the end of this semester. Professor Johnson's points clearly emphasize the concepts of A.S.E. and offers a clear insight on how and what to gain in the learning process. In programming, often times it can be easy for a programmer to lose themselves in coding and not have a strong knack to work in groups with other individuals. It is more crucial than ever in this field to provide conditions, which promote communication and interaction with others. Sometimes improving oneself is more important than participating in a competition and coming out victorious. In my experience, competitions promote all forms of benefit such as motivating an individual to increase their efforts in accomplishing a task or assignment.
