1) Overview

The Problem:
Currently, UH students are required to sign in/out on the white board in person to reserve usage for the basketball court. A major issue
is the waiting time each student spends in order to sign in and actually play. 

The Solution:
Our app will allow UH students to sign in where ever they choose to do on their mobile devices. Rather than having to sign in in person, they can do it anywhere on or off campus. This will prevent wasted time and allow time efficiency. It is more organized and helps to ensure more play time.

2) Mockup Page Ideas

Sign in/out
Schedule of available times
Operation hours
Other important information

3) Use case ideas

Log in or register at the welcome page -> 
account user page -> log in -> home page -> edits
admin user page -> log in -> home page -> edits
-> Link to calendar for daily/weekly schedule
-> Link to sports activities
-> Link to staff/faculty

4) Beyond the basics

Implement a support page including student suggestions, questions and/or concerns
Impletement a help page for how to use website
